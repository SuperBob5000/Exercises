Greedy algorithm 

As in Kruskal's algorithm, first sort the edges in the increasing order of weights.
Starting with the least cost edge, look at the edges one by one and select an edge only if the edge, together with already selected edges,
1.
does not cause a vertex to have degree three or more
2.
does not form a cycle, unless the number of selected edges equals the number of vertices in the graph.

obtain matrix from csv

calculate weights between vertices 

sort from smallest weight to largest weight 

select edges that upholds above rules else remove them 

order from A onwards 

return the path order, total weight and computational time
